# Unleaded Full-Stack Developer Technical Challenge

You are tasked to create a basic web page layout from the attached design. The reason for this exercise is to test your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skillset through the lens of maintainability, responsiveness, performance, design, and general attention to detail.

We are only providing desktop resolution mock ups, we expect you to implement a fully responsive layout using your best judgement. Finely crafted web designs come to life in the browser and we'd love to see how you approach design implementation choices in the absence of a complete articulation by a visual designer.

Use your best judgement when it comes to any decisions or requirements not defined in this exercise, including potential modules, libraries, or frameworks used to create the interface, so long as you reasonably adhere to modern front-end best practices.

Please loosly keep track of your time, as we'd like to understand rougly how much effort went into your outcome. This also helps us ensure we are not overwhelming candidates with our exercises. If you do not have time to finish every aspect of the project, just make sure the parts you do finish are complete and set to our expectations. Please feel free to describe a few changes or enhancements you're aware of that you'd work on with more time.

Please include all source and build process configuration files in your submission.

# Please do not use a starter theme or template to complete this exercise

While there may be times we use internal frameworks, themes, or templates. We ideally want to gauge your ability to architect the various aspects of the layout.

# BONUS challenge

Our senior Full-Stack Developer roles at Unleaded carry an expection of understanding and knowledge of your more common PHP-based content management systems. That being said, our agency CMS of choice is Craft CMS (https://craftcms.com/). If you are feeling up to the task, please prepare a basic Craft CMS installation, basic "Singles" template with a few editable fields, Twig variables implementation, and basic Twig template logic. Otherwise, the majority of the page can be assumed to be static.

Please provide the entire Craft CMS installation folder and database export.
